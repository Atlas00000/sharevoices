  * Dockerize services in **Phase 2** (`docker-compose.yml` for local dev, Kubernetes for production).  
  * Separate Dockerfiles for `client/`, `server/services/*`, and databases.  
* **Optimization**:  
  * Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.  
  * Set up `docker-compose.yml` in **Phase 1** for consistent local environments.  
  * Include health checks in Docker configurations to detect container issues.

### **3.8 User Client Enforcement**

* **Implementation**:  
  * Enforce client-side validation for user inputs (e.g., email format, password strength) using React forms.  
  * Server-side validation to reject invalid client requests (e.g., missing headers).  
* **Error Handling**:  
  * Display user-friendly error messages (e.g., “Invalid email format”) with Slack-like illustrations.  
  * Log client errors (e.g., failed API calls) to Sentry for debugging.  
* **Optimization**:  
  * Implement validation libraries (e.g., Formik, Yup) in **Phase 2** to reduce client-side errors.

### **3.9 Early Backend and API Integration**

* **Implementation**:  
  * Develop RESTful APIs in **Phase 2** for core features (e.g., `/api/articles`, `/api/auth`).  
  * Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation (`docs/api.md`).  
* **Optimization**:  
  * Mock APIs with tools like MSW (Mock Service Worker) in **Phase 1** for frontend development.  
  * Integrate frontend with backend in **Phase 2** to test end-to-end flows early.  
  * Use environment-specific API endpoints (e.g., `dev.api.sharedvoices.com`) via `.env` files.
