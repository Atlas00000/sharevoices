### **2.1 Design Tokens & System**

* **Scalable Tokens**: Colors, spacings, typography scales, and radii defined as design tokens (CSS variables \+ `tailwind.config.js`) for easy theming.

* **Atomic Architecture**: “Atoms” (buttons, inputs), “Molecules” (card, navbar), “Organisms” (featured grid), and “Templates” encourage reuse and faster iteration—ideal for Storybook documentation.

### **2.2 Typography**

* **System Sans-Serif Stack**: Fallbacks ensure performance; Roboto-like feel on supporting platforms.

* **Scale**: Modular scale (1.2× step) from `text-sm` to `text-6xl`.

* **Readability**: 1.5× line-height on body text; responsive clamp sizing for fluid type.

### **2.3 Color & Theming**

* **Primary Brand**: HSL-driven Blue (221°, 83%, 53%) for CTAs, links, and highlights.

* **SDG Palette**: Mapped to 17 SDGs via Tailwind’s extended colors—easily swapped or darkened via tokens.

* **Neutral & Dark Mode**: Gray-scale 50–900 with class-based dark mode; WCAG AA contrast guaranteed.

* **Future-Proofing**: Light/dark \+ custom user themes via CSS variables; easy integration of AI-generated palettes.

### **2.4 Spacing & Layout**

* **8px Baseline Grid**: Consistent spacing (`p-4`, `gap-6`), responsive overrides (`md:px-6`).

* **Flex & Grid Mix**: CSS Grid for multi-column sections; Flex for nav and form layouts—optimizes adaptivity.

---

## **3\. Component Breakdown**

### **3.1 Navigation Bar**

* **Sticky, Frosted Glass**: `backdrop-blur-lg` \+ semi-transparent background.

* **Responsive**: Hamburger → drawer on mobile; hover transitions on desktop.

* **Forward View**: Plug‐and‐play user menu, dynamic search suggestions, multi-language switch.

### **3.2 Hero Section**

* **Edge-to-Edge Visual**: Background image with gradient overlay for text legibility.

* **Modular CTAs**: Primary/outline buttons with variant props (size, icon).

* **Accessibility**: Skip‐to‐content link; alt text and ARIA roles baked in.

### **3.3 Featured & Latest Articles**

* **Card Components**:

  * **FeaturedArticleCard**: large image, tag, title, metadata.

  * **ArticleCard**: compact version with 4:3 thumbnail.

* **Interactions**:

  * Hover scale & shadow.

  * Intersection-observer lazy load.

* **Scalability**: Virtualized list for long feeds; infinite scroll or “Load More.”

### **3.4 Category Grid**

* **Icon-Driven Cards**: Color-coded by SDG theme, full-card click area.

* **Future Enhancement**: Drag-and-drop reordering; AI-suggested categories based on user behavior.

### **3.5 Newsletter & Footer**

* **Newsletter**: Two-column form, real-time validation, success toast animation.

* **Footer**: Logical sitemap in a responsive grid; social links with focus states.

* **Forward View**: Integrate personalization hints (e.g., “Because you read…”), multilingual legal links.

## **4\. Interaction & Accessibility**

### **4.1 Micro-Interactions**

* **Unified Transition**: `transition-all duration-300 ease-out` tokenized.

* **Advanced Effects**: Scroll-triggered reveals (Framer Motion); parallax hero.

### **4.2 Responsive Strategy**

* **Mobile-First**: Stacked layouts → multi-col at breakpoints.

* **Performance**: Media-query–driven CSS, critical CSS inlining.

### **4.3 Accessibility**

* **Semantic HTML & ARIA**: Proper landmarks, roles, and hidden labels.

* **Keyboard & Screen Reader**: Logical tab order, visible focus, `aria-live` regions for notifications.

* **Contrast Audits**: Automated CI checks via axe-core; continuous compliance.

---

## **5\. Technical Architecture**

### **5.1 Component & Code Organization**

* **Monorepo (Turborepo/Nx)**: Shared `ui/`, isolated `web/`, `api/` folders.

* **Storybook**: Live docs with knobs for theme and content variations.

* **Type Safety**: Shared Zod schemas \+ TypeScript inference.

### **5.2 Styling & Theming**

// tailwind.config.js

module.exports \= {

  darkMode: 'class',

  theme: {

    extend: {

      colors: { primary: 'hsl(221,83%,53%)', 'sdg-6': '\#059669', /\* … \*/ },

      spacing: { 18: '4.5rem', 22: '5.5rem' },

    },

  },

};

### **5.3 Performance & Optimization**

* **Images**: Next/Image with AVIF support and `<picture>` fallback.

* **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for above-the-fold vs. offscreen components.

* **Caching & CDN**: ISR, SWR for data fetching, edge caching for API.

---

## **6\. Future Roadmap**

1. **AI-Driven Personalization**:

   * Dynamic content ordering via on-device ML.

   * Auto-theme switching based on time of day or user profile.

2. **Enhanced Visualization**:

   * Interactive SDG data dashboards with recharts or D3.

   * In-page annotations and collaborative commenting.

3. **Deeper Accessibility**:

   * Voice command navigation.

   * Real-time captioning for embedded media.

4. **DesignOps Integration**:

   * Automated audits in CI (lint-staged, Prettier, Stylelint).

   * Design token sync between Figma and code via Style Dictionary.

## **7\. Conclusion**

The revised Shared Voices UI not only fulfills current PRD objectives—clarity, engagement, modularity, accessibility—but is architected for rapid iteration, AI personalization, and robust theming. By codifying design tokens, adopting an atomic component library, and integrating CI-backed accessibility/performance checks, the platform is positioned to evolve seamlessly alongside user needs and emerging technologies.

# **Folder Structure: Shared Voices News/Media Platform**

## **Overview**

The folder structure for **Shared Voices** is a **Triad Monorepo Structure**, part of the **ClarityStack Workflow**, designed to ensure clear separation of concerns, assigned responsibilities, and scalability. It organizes the codebase into three primary top-level directories—`client/`, `server/`, and `db/`—within the project root, reflecting a domain-driven, microservices-based, and layered architecture. This structure supports the platform’s mission to deliver a visually appealing, engaging, and accessible news/media experience, inspired by platforms like UNDP, UN SDG, UNICEF, UN Innovation Network, and SDG Innovation Commons.

### **Why This Structure Fits**

* **Clear Separation**: The `client/`, `server/`, and `db/` directories distinctly separate the presentation layer (frontend), business logic (backend), and data layer, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.  
* **Domain-Driven Design**: Subdirectories within `server/services/` (e.g., `content/`, `user/`) align with specific business domains, enabling modular development and microservices deployment.  
* **Monorepo Benefits**: A single repository unifies version control, shared tooling, and dependencies, streamlining collaboration across frontend, backend, and database teams.  
* **Scalability**: The structure supports future features (e.g., multilingual support, forums) through modular components and microservices, with Docker and CI/CD integration for rapid scaling.  
* **Agile Workflow**: The organization facilitates iterative development, with clear documentation and testing directories to support Agile practices and frequent releases.  
* **Alignment with Reference Platforms**: The clean, modular structure mirrors the robust, user-centric architectures of UNDP and UNICEF, ensuring global accessibility and maintainability.

### **Naming for Future Reference**

* **Triad Monorepo Structure**: Refers to the three core directories (`client/`, `server/`, `db/`) that anchor the project, housed in a single repository for cohesive management.  
* **ClarityStack Workflow**: Emphasizes the clear, assigned organization and full-stack integration, with a focus on GitOps-driven CI/CD and Agile development.

This structure and workflow can be reused for similar domain-driven, full-stack projects, referenced as:  
*"We’ll adopt the ClarityStack Workflow with a Triad Monorepo Structure to ensure clear separation, streamline CI/CD, and enable Agile delivery."*

## **Explanation of Key Directories**

* **`client/`**: Contains the React.js frontend, organized to support modular UI components (inspired by UNICEF’s playful design) and pages for articles, search, and user profiles. The `assets/` and `styles/` folders align with the FAANG-inspired visual ethos (e.g., Apple’s minimalism, Netflix’s dark palette).  
* **`server/`**: Houses microservices (`content/`, `user/`, etc.) to support domain-driven logic, reflecting the modular backend of platforms like UNDP. Each service is self-contained with its own `src/`, `config/`, and `tests/`, enabling independent deployment.  
* **`db/`**: Separates database-related files (schemas, migrations, seeds) for MongoDB and PostgreSQL, ensuring clear data layer management. This supports the platform’s need for flexible content storage (MongoDB) and structured user data (PostgreSQL).  
* **`config/`**: Centralizes global configurations (e.g., environment variables, Docker) for consistency across client, server, and database layers.  
* **`docs/`**: Stores documentation to support Agile collaboration, including architecture and UI/UX details, inspired by the clear communication of reference platforms.  
* **`scripts/` and `.github/`**: Enable GitOps-driven CI/CD, with scripts for deployment and testing, aligning with the scalable workflows of modern platforms.

## **Why This Structure Fits**

* **Domain-Driven**: The `client/`, `server/`, and `db/` separation, with microservices in `server/services/`, aligns with DDD by organizing code around business domains (e.g., content, user management).  
* **Monorepo**: A single repository simplifies dependency management and tooling, as seen in the root-level `package.json` and `docker-compose.yml`.  
* **Microservices**: Independent services allow for scalable, isolated development, mirroring the robust architectures of UNDP and UNICEF.  
* **Layered Separation**: The triad structure ensures clear boundaries between presentation, logic, and data layers, enhancing maintainability.  
* **ClarityStack Workflow**: The structure supports Agile development with modular components, automated CI/CD (via `.github/workflows/`), and comprehensive documentation, enabling rapid iteration and scalability.

## **Future Reference**

The **Triad Monorepo Structure** and **ClarityStack Workflow** can be applied to other full-stack, domain-driven projects. For example:  
*"We’ll use the Triad Monorepo Structure to separate client, server, and database layers, paired with the ClarityStack Workflow for modular development and automated CI/CD."*

## **Notes**

* **Alignment with Requirements**: The `client/`, `server/`, and `db/` directories are top-level within the project root (`shared-voices/`), as requested, ensuring clear separation.  
* **Inspiration from Reference Platforms**: The structure reflects the clean, modular, and user-centric architectures of UNDP, UNICEF, and others, with a focus on scalability and maintainability.  
* **Artifact ID**: A new `artifact_id` (`d8c9f2e7-3b4a-4f9c-8e3b-6a7b2f1c0e5d`) is used as this is a distinct artifact for the folder structure, separate from previous documents.  
* **Scalability**: The monorepo and microservices design support future features (e.g., multilingual support, forums) by maintaining modularity and leveraging Docker/Kubernetes.
